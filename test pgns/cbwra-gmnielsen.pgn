1.d4 g6
{I doubt this the best choice for a computer. The risk of ending up in closed
strategic positions is huge. If one considers the last matches with Fritz and
Junior the basically went for some lines in the Slav/meran leading to lively
piece-play.} 

2.c4 Bg7 3.e4 d6 4.Nc3 Nf6 5.Nf3 O-O 6.Be2 e5 7.O-O 7...a5
{This surprised me. It`s a little known variation favored by now German Grandmaster
Glek. Apparently its mentioned in ChessBrain`s opening book, but only with a 4% 
chance of being played.Normally I would go for 7...Nc6 8 d5 Ne7 which is the main 
line. I intended 9 Kh1!? not maybe the best move, but a late favorite of my 
Compatriot Bent Larsen. It would have thrown ChessBrain out of its book, probably 
answering 9...b6? according to the programmers. This shows why computers shouldn`t
go for closed positions. Obviously black should prepare f5 in such positions. Not 
weaken his queenside.}

8.Re1
{An excellent move, still however the clever choice was 8 d5! Closing the position.
I however was curious, and decided to play the move I Thought was best, not going 
for anti computer strategies.} 

8...exd4
{Not giving me the chance to change my mind. Actually the move is dubious, the 
structure now arising is definitely better for white, but a though and patient 
defender might do ok as black. ChessBrain is certainly such.}
 
9.Nxd4 Bd7  10.Bg5 Nc6 
{10...h6 11 Be3 followed by Qd2 would just help white.} 

11.Nxc6 Bxc6 12.f3 Qd7 13.Qd2 Rfe8 14.Rac1 
{White is for sure better here. Blacks position is quite without any prospect, the 
only advantage being its solidity. However Computers can do well in such. A human 
would probably try and get some counter play preparing f5, here it would just 
make whites task much easier. ChessBrain does well in the coming phase. [14.Nd5!? 
Might have been the right moment. I wasnï¿½t sure I had enough after: 14...Nxd5 15.cxd5 
Bb5 Though. Here f5 is actually a relevant way of getting counter play.]} 

14...h5 
{I like this move. It weakens a bit yes, but still nothing fatal. Nh7 is now 
possible now and then, and a white Nd5 can be answered with Nh7 exactly.} 

15.Kh1 Nh7 16.Bh6 Bxh6 17.Qxh6 Re5 18.Nd5 {[18.f4 Re6 19.f5 gxf5 20.Qxh5 Rg6 Is 
pretty unclear. I might be better in such concrete lines, but it`s not what you want 
against the machine.]}
 
18...Rae8 19.Qd2 b6  20.Bd3 Qd8 21.Rf1 {Signaling my intensions to run forward the 
f-pawn. Here in general I was hoping ChessBrain would take on d5. Then having taken 
back with the c-pawn I would generate huge pressure against c7, being clearly better 
in a dry position. Actually it might have been a mistake placing the rook on c1 if 
that`s been my hope. Then it becomes less attractive for black to take on d5. Such 
tricks might work against a machine.}

21...Nf6 22.b3 Bb7 23.Qc2 23...Nd7 
{As usual I think white has a stable edge, but its not getting bigger. Normally it 
needs a bit of cooperation to win such positions, but typically a player who ended 
up like this, as black will continue making mistakes! ChessBrain just sits tight, 
the clever strategy, so difficult for humans though.} 

24.f4 
{Not really the way to go, but again curiosity played a role. Playing a3+b4 was 
sensible and safe.} 

24...R5e6 25.e5 25...c6 
{A cold shower, still it was too naive hoping for 25...dxe5 26 f5! Especially as 
white gets his material back more or less immediately.} 

26.f5 
{Realizing this leads to a draw, however I felt I passed the point of no return. 
Interesting was 26 Nc3 where I feared 26...Nc5! [26.Nc3 Nc5 what I missed was 27 Ne4 
Nxe4 28 Bxe4 f5! this rules out my f5 pushes and next it will just take on e5. 
27 Rcd1!? is suggested by many, its a good move, but still I find the position 
unclear. 27...f5!? being an good answer. In general its possible white can find an 
edge here, but playing a position opening up like this, is playing against odds with 
a machine.]}

26...gxf5 27.Bxf5 cxd5 28.Bxe6 Rxe6 29.Rxf7 
{Sweet, unfortunately only giving me a draw.}

29...Kxf7 30.Qh7+ Ke8  31.Qxh5+  31...Ke7 32.Qg5+ Ke8 33.Qh5+ Ke7 34.Qh7+
{Here I offered a draw. Normally I would have repeated once more, making it a 
threefold repetition, however ChessBrain was low on time, and this was the correct 
result, instead of some nonsense win on time in a dead drawn position. As usual the 
computer both impresses as well as plays some awful moves. Strategically it`s pretty 
weak, but in defense and calculations is horribly strong. This mixture means humans 
versus machines to my mind always will be a tense and rather equal struggle. I for 
one at least enjoyed being part of one. 1/2-1/2}
1/2-1/2
